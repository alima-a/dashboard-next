# 📊 My Next.js Dashboard App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).  

Built with ❤️ using **React 19**, **TypeScript**, **Material UI (MUI v7)**, **Redux Toolkit**, **React Hook Form**, **Jest**, and **Chart.js** — wrapped together in a clean, modular structure with testing and linting support.

I hope this project will be easy to review. 😄

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Running Tests

To run all tests once:

```bash
npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode (useful for development):

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Mobile View Tip

If you want to check how the app looks on mobile:

**After resizing the browser window to a mobile width, refresh the page —
this ensures Next.js rehydrates the correct responsive layout. 🪄**

Without the refresh, you might see the desktop structure misaligned on smaller screens.
